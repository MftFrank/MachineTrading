%% MATLAB pairs trading strategy
% This demo uses MATLAB and the <http://www.tadeveloper.com Technical Analysis (TA) Developer Toolbox>
% to create and test a <http://www.tadeveloper.com/docs/84-matlab-pairs-trading pairs trading strategy>. The TA Developer toolbox
% complements the existing computational finance toolboxes by adding
% advanced backtesting functionalities like portfolio backtesting,
% calculation of standard trading metrics and an interactive graphical user
% interface that allows applying technical indicators via drap&drop. 

%% Example: Australia - Canada spread
% This first step in creating a pairs trading strategy is choosing
% two financial instruments that are historically correlated. The pairs
% trading strategy takes advantage of short term divergence by entering a
% short position in one instrument and a long position in the other. The
% strategy assumes that the pair will converge in the long term. By being
% short in one instrument and long in the correlated instrument this
% strategy is market neutral. For example if the stock market crashes
% profits from shorting one instrument should offset the losses from the
% long position. 
% In this demo we use the fact that Australia and Canada are two 
% resource-rich countries which have an economic and statistical correlation
% as explained here:

%% Downloading the data
% For the pairs trading strategy we use the iShares MSCI Australia Index
% (EWA) as a proxy for the Australian economy and the iShares MSCI Canada
% Index (EWC) as a proxy for the Canadian economy.
% The data can be downloaded from Yahoo finance by using the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39858-download-yahoo-finance-data-for-trading-and-backtesting
% getyahoo10.m> script from the MATLAB file exchange. <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39858-download-yahoo-finance-data-for-trading-and-backtesting
% getyahoo10.m> downloads 10 years of daily data from Yahoo finance and saves
% the downloaded files in the specified directory.
getyahoo10('EWA,EWC','C:\StockData');

%%
% The downloaded data can then be imported into the
% <http://www.tadeveloper.com TA Developer Toolbox> as described here:

%% Creating a new strategy m-file
% A trading strategy consists of a MATLAB function with a single parameter 
% called sys. The sys parameter contains trading system data like the open, 
% high, low and close prices of a stock or a future. We will add entry and 
% exit trading rules to this trading strategy m-file. No additional writing
% of backtesting code is required. The backting and performance evaluation
% is all handled by the <http://www.tadeveloper.com Technical Analysis (TA)
% Developer Toolbox>.
% The empty trading strategy should look similar this and servers as a
% starting point for every trading strategy.
function PairsTradingStrategy(sys)

end

%% Defining the primary and secondary symbols
% In our trading strategy we start with defining the symbol names of the
% primary and secondary instruments, as well as the watchlist name that has
% been selected during the data import. Putting these values in variables
% allows easily adjusting the strategy to other pairs later.
PrimarySymbol = 'EWA';
SecondarySymbol = 'EWC';
WatchlistName='AUCASpread';

%% Trading parameters
% Trading parameters can be used in a parameter sweep. If we are not
% running a parameter sweep, these parameters will default to the second 
% parameter passed to the 'GetTradingParameter' function. 
AveragePeriod=sys.GetTradingParameter('Period', 100);
UpperThreshold=sys.GetTradingParameter('UpperThreshold', 1.5);
LowerThreshold=sys.GetTradingParameter('LowerThreshold', 1);

%% Calculating and plotting the ratio, average, standard deviation and z-score
% Ratio between primary (EWA) and secondary (EWC)
PairRatio = Primary.Close/Secondary.Close;
Average = Sma(PairRatio, AveragePeriod);
%%
% Standard deviation
RatioStdDev = StdDev(PairRatio, AveragePeriod);

%%
% Calculate the z-score and plot the thresholds. The z-score indicates how
% many standard deviations an observation is above or below the mean.
ZScore = (PairRatio - Average) / RatioStdDev;
ZScore.Name = 'ZScore';
ZScoreUpper=DataSeries(sys.Date, 'Upper Threshold', sys.BarData.Frequency, UpperThreshold);
ZScoreUpperNegative=DataSeries(sys.Date, 'Negative Upper Threshold', sys.BarData.Frequency, -1* UpperThreshold);
ZScoreLower=DataSeries(sys.Date, 'Lower Threshold', sys.BarData.Frequency, LowerThreshold);
ZScoreLowerNegative=DataSeries(sys.Date, 'Negative Lower Threshold', sys.BarData.Frequency, -1 * LowerThreshold);

PlotDataSeries(sys, ZScore, 'blue', 'ZScore');
PlotDataSeries(sys, ZScoreUpper, 'red', 'ZScore');
PlotDataSeries(sys, ZScoreLower, 'green', 'ZScore');
PlotDataSeries(sys, ZScoreLowerNegative, 'green', 'ZScore');
PlotDataSeries(sys, ZScoreUpperNegative, 'red', 'ZScore');
%%
%
% <<pairs-trading-zscore.png>>
%
%% Primary entry and exit signals
% ZScoreUpper defaults to 1.5 and ZScoreLower defaults to 1. So we enter a
% short position in the primary (EWA) when the z-score exceeds 1.5 standard
% deviations (upper red line) and exit the short position when the z-score falls below 1
% standard deviation (upper green line).
AddShortSignal(sys, ZScore>=ZScoreUpper, ZScore<=ZScoreLower);
%%
% Add long position when the z-score falls below -1.5 standard deviations
% (lower red line) and exit long position when the z-score rises above -1
% standard deviations (lower green line).
AddLongSignal(sys, ZScore<=ZScoreUpperNegative, ZScore>=ZScoreLowerNegative);

%% Secondary entry and exit signals
% Switch to the secondary context (EWC). All functions called after
% 'SwitchSymbol' are executed on the secordary symbol until 
% 'RestoreSymbol' is called.
SwitchSymbol(sys, SecondarySymbol, true);
% Entry and exit rules for EWC are the exact inverse of the rules for EWA. 
AddLongSignal(sys, ZScore>=ZScoreUpper, ZScore<=ZScoreLower);
AddShortSignal(sys, ZScore<=ZScoreUpperNegative, ZScore>=ZScoreLowerNegative);
RestoreSymbol(sys);

%% Backtesting the strategy
% Type 'tadeveloper' into the MATLAB command prompt to open up the 
% TA Developer graphical user interface. Click File>Open from the menu and 
% browse to the location where you saved the PairsTradingStrategy.m strategy and open the file.
%%
% Before executing the strategy, we need to set a few parameters first. 
% In the bottom right corner is a window called Properties. This window contains 
% important execution parameters. We will set the starting capital for the 
% simulation to 100000. The position type is set to 'Percent' and the position 
% amount is set to 50 which means that 50% of the available capital is used per trade.
% 
% <<pairs-trading-parameters.png>>
% 
%%
% Make sure the watchlist root node is selected in the Symbols window. 
% You should see the backtest panel. Press the green Play button the start the simulation.
% 
% <<pairs-backtestpanel.png>>
%

%% Performance evaluation
% When the strategy has executed successfully, the 'Statistics' tab becomes available. 
% It shows various trading metrics like the Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, 
% Sortino Ratio, Ulcer Index, Number of Trades and many more. 
% These metrics are divided into 'All' (for all simulated trades), 
% 'Long' (long trades only) and 'Short' (short trades only). 
% In addition to the metrics page, a list of all executed trades and an
% equity curve are calculated and displayed.

%% Parameter sweep
% So far we used 1.5 as an upper threshold and 1 as an lower threshold for
% the z-score to enter and exit our spread position. MATLAB makes it easy
% to perform a parameter sweep to run through a number of values to
% determine the optimal parameter values. The steps involved in running a
% parameter sweep are explained here
% <http://www.tadeveloper.com/docs/80-matlab-algo-trading MATLAB Algo
% Trading> under the subheading 'Parmeter Optimization'.

%%
% We ran a parameter sweep and set the range for the lower boundary
% threshold from 0 to 1 and the range for the upper boundary threshold from
% 1 to 2. As the variable to optimize we chose the Sharpe Ratio, but any
% other metric (e.g. Total Profit, Sortino Ratio etc.) could be used. 
% The result can be seen in the Surface/Contour plot below.
