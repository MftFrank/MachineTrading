%% Required Dependencies
% You will need to have MATLAB, Finanical Toolbox, and Parallel Computing
% Toolbox to run the example MATLAB files.  To run the Simulink(R) and
% StateFlow example, you will need those products as well.
%

%% Data
% The data provided with these examples is from public data sources and was
% obtained from tickdata.com sample data sets.

%% Read the Pblished Examples
% To get started you can read the examples in the html folder.  These are
% pulished from the demos and example files.  Reading through them will
% give you a complete example.  You can also run the examples and walk
% through them using cell mode (Run and Advance in the Toolstrip).

%% Rotman Trading Simulator
% If you want to play with a realistic system, you can hook up the examples
% here with the Rotman Trader Toolbox (on the MATLAB Central file exchange)
% to play with simulated data.  This is a simulator created by the
% University of Toronto.
